## GitHub Issues
Please try and label any issue as:

-   `bug`: clearly a defect or unwanted behavior (errors, performance issues)
-   `enhancement`: making an existing, working feature better (UI improvements, better integration)
-   `feature`: an entirely new feature

Before creating an issue, please:

1.  **Search the existing issues**  to see if an issue already exists (and if so, throw in a handy  üëç)!

2.  **Make sure you're running the latest version of Boatswain**. The bug may already be fixed!

3.  **Explain how to reproduce the bug**. This will save maintainers tons of time!


Please be as detailed as possible. Include a description of your environment and steps on how to reproduce a bug.

## Pull Requests
We're thrilled to receive pull requests of any kind. Anything from bug fix, tests or new features are welcome.

That said, please let us know what you're planning to do! For large changes always create a proposal. Maintainers will love to give you advice on building it and it keeps the app's design coherent.
