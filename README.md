Boatswain is an open source, multiple platforms application that managing your docker containers in an easiest manner. The ultimate goal of this project is to help you to minimise the number of applications that you would need to install separately into your machine, instead, grouping all of them into one single place. And, in the same time, providing you a modern, easy to use User Interface, which you allow you to focus on the things that important to you.

## Introduction

From the main UI of Boatswain, you can easily add or remove your docker containers, configure your port mapping, volume mapping, setting up your environment variables, overwrite your container's entrypoint, etc. You can also create and map a config shortcut to the main UI for easier configuration, or may be just for conventional visualisation.

Boatswain also allows you to group your containers together (i.e web stack, log stack, etc), or managing multiple workspaces (i.e home workspace or project X), switching between workspaces, checking container logs with our built-in log viewer, opening container's terminal, filtering your container, etc. You can also expand your container when you need to change or check some informations, or collapse it when done. 

Built from PyQT and applied pyqtdeploy technique for building release, the final release application is both lightweight and as fast as any native application. While maintain the same user experiences between multiple platforms, including MacOS, Windows and Linux.

Boatswain also comes with our open source, cross platform [Auto Updater](https://github.com/theboatswain/boatswain_updater)  to make sure your machine is always up to date with the newest version of Boatswain.
